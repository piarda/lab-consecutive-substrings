Please add your pseudocode to this file
And a written explanation of your solution



Pseudocode:

Function createConsecutiveSubstrings(str):
    Create an empty list called substrings

    For each start point and each end point in the string:
        Take the part of the string from the start to the end
        Add that part to the list of the substrings

    Return the substrings list



Solution Explanation:

The solution uses a brute-force approach with two nested loops.
These two nested loops cause quadratic time because:
 - The outer loop iterates over each index of the string as a potential starting point for substrings.
 - The inner loop generates substrings by iterating from the start index to the end of the string.
The results is O(n^2) time complexity.
